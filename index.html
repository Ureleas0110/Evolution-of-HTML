<h2> Evolution of HTML</h2> 

<br><p>Since the inception of the World Wide Web there has been a number of versions of HTML, which are shown below</p> <br> 

<br> 

<h2>Evolution of HTML from HTML 2.0 to HTML5  </h2> 

<sub heading> HTML Version 2.0 </sub heading> 

<br><p> .HTML version 2.0 was develpoed in 1995 with the basic intention of improving 

HTML version 1.0, Now a standard got started to develop so as to maintain common rules and regulations 

across different browsers. HTML 2.0 has improved a lot in terms of the markup tags. 

In HTML 2.0 version concept of form came into action. Forms were developed, but still, 

they had basic tags lie text boxes, buttons,etc. 

Also the table came as an HTML tag, Now in HTML tag 2.0, browsers also came with the 

concept of creating their own layers of tags that were specific to the browser itself, 

W3C was also formed. The main intention of W3C is to maintain standards across different 

web browsers so that these browsers understand and render HTML tags in a similar manner. 

<br> 

<br><sub heading> HTML Version 3.2 </sub heading><br> 

<br><p> It was developed in 1997. After HTML 2.0 was develpoed, the next version of html 

was 3.2, with version 3.2 of HTML, HTML tags were further improved. it is worth noting that 

because of W3C standard maintenance , the newer version of HTML was 3.2 insted of 3. 

Now HTML has better support for new form elements, Another important feature that HTML 3.2 

implemented was support for CSS, CSS stanmd for (Cascading Style Sheet), it is CSS that provide features 

to make HTML tags look better on rendering it on browsers, CSS helps to style HTML elements. 

With the upgradation of browsers to HTML 3.2, the browser also supported for frame tags, although HTML 

specifications still do not support frame markup tags.	 <br></p> 

<br> 

<br><sub heading> HTML Version 4.01 <br></sub heading> 

<br><p> It was develpoed in 1999. It extended the supporr of cascading styling sheets, 

In version 3.2, CSS were embedded in HTML page itself. Therefore, if the website has 

various web pages to apply to the style of each page, we must place CSS on each web page 

, Hence there was arepetition of the same block of CSS. 

To overcome this thing, in Version 4.01 concept of an external styling sheet emerged, 

under this concept, an external CSS file could be developed, and this external styling 

could be included in HTML itself,HTML 4.01 provided support for further new tags of HTML. 

<br></p> 

<br> 

<br><sub heading>HTML Version 5.1<br></sub heading> 

<br><p>This is the latest version of HTML, for a developer, it could be used in 2014, 

it came up with lots of HTML tag support, HTML5 provided support for new form elements 

like input elements of different types; geolocations support tags, etc	<br></p>

<h3> The Evolution of CSS </h3><br> 

<br><sub heading>Brief Summary<br></sub heading> 

<br><p>CSS was created to replace all the formatting markup,all the Font and BR tags, 

with a simple style sheet language, Using CSS, you could control the style of an entire 

website with a few lines of code in a single file<br></p> 

<br> 

<br><sub heading>CSS Version 1<br></sub heading> 

<br><p> CSS Version 1 didnt have any real layout tools, it had width and height 

properties, which replaced their namesake HTML attributes, and it had floats, 

which replaced the align attribute on IMG and TABLE, this was not intended or 

at that time used for coarse layout but for, well, floats, Tables were still 

the accepted way of handling 2D layout; there was nothing else. and of course 

  margins and padding provided a much-needed relief from sapcer gifs and BR tags. 

<br></p> 

<br><sub heading>CSS Version 2 <br></sub heading> 

<br><p>CSS version 2 which was released in 1998, W3C brought the Webs stae-of-the-art 

  layout tool to CSS: you could turn any collection of HTML elements into a display 

  property. Together with other values of the display , CSS Version 2 promised the ability 

  to dissociate the layout you desired from tags you used, freeing up authors to use more appropriate 

  semantic markup. Navigation lists could be displayed as tab navigation, and equal-height columns became a 

  one-liner in CSS. Unfortunately, even though there was cross-browser support in Gecko, Opera and KHTML/Webkit, 

  teh lack of support in IE until version 8 made CSS Tables unusable on the web. 

  <br></p> 

  <br><sub heading>CSS Version 3<br></sub heading> 

  <br><p>Beyond Version 2 CSS is modularized: what this means is its split up into parts , that can each 

   progress individually, levelling up at its own pace.<br></p>
